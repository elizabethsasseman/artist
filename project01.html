              <p class="px-3">I led a UX initiative for a construction delivery app start-up. I performed research
              in order to understand our users and our competitors better so I could help guide business decisions and strategy. I
              designed the app to be more centered around our unique user-base. I was brought in as the company's first UX
              designer. My role was to do what I do best in the areas of UX and UI design.
              It was left fairly open for me to determine what I would do to contribute to and benefit the company.

              <p class="px-3">I worked with the CEO, Anthony on understanding business goals, what we already know about
              our users, on the competitive analysis I'd be performing, and on gathering participants for user research.</p>
              <p class="px-3">I worked with the company's only software engineer, Lucas, on the actual designs of the app by providing
              mockups. We collaborated on designs and functionality, and their ability to meet business needs as an MVP.</p>
              <p class="px-3">I interviewed several operations people within our company as well as a handful of sales
              representatives our company works with to understand our users better.</p>

              <h3 class="raleway300 px-3">Internal Research</h3>
              <p class="px-3">I began working with Anthony to understand his business goals for the company. I
              wanted to make sure I had a clear understanding of his priorities so I could perform research appropriately. I
              asked questions like: "What are the goals of the product?" and "Are there ways it isn't meeting current goals and in
              what ways?" My ability to understand what is and isn't working would help guide the formation of the questions
              I would ask while researching our competitors and our users.</p>
              <p class="px-3">I also wanted to understand the process of how a user would place an order for construction
              delivery, the process of that delivery, and how our different users operate within this system.</p>
              <p class="px-3">Below is a diagram I created to better understand the system and each type of user.</p>

              <h3 class="raleway300 px-3">Competitive Analysis</h3>
              <p class="px-3">Once I understood the goals of the company, I was ready to begin a competitive analysis. I
              was primarily concerned with what features our competitors have that we don't have, and what features we have
              that our competitors don't have. This information would allow me to develop questions to ask our users to
              determine what of these features they actually value.</p>

              <h3 class="raleway300 px-3">User Research</h3>
              <p class="px-3">I interviewed individuals from two teams of sales representatives who work with us to spread
              word of our app. These sales reps. are also part of our user base. They were a great starting point in
              not only understanding each type of user, but also the dynamics between them and their financial motivations.</p>
              <p class="px-3">I talked with several individuals on our internal operations team who have daily contact with each
              of our user types. I set up a shared document so they could begin documenting what they hear from our users. I decided
              this would be a great way to create a continuous flow of feedback. This information would also be valuable in
              helping me form additional questions to ask our users.</p>
              <p class="px-3">The CEO is currently putting together an incentive plan that the business can afford
              in rewarding actual users for their feedback. So at this point, I have not interviewed any user types directly
              aside from our sales reps.</p>

              <p class="px-3">Once I began to understand our different users and their different motivations and values, I began
              developing user personas for each of the six user types I determined we have. These personas would help us understand
              our users even better, they'd help us develop questions to fill in the information gaps in what we don't know, and
              they'd help us determine how we could simplify our product based on what our users don't care about.</p>
              <p class="px-3">Below is a screen from my persona report of one type of user. You may view the full report below that.</p>

              <h3 class="raleway300 px-3">Brand Development</h3>
              <p class="px-3">I took it upon myself to develop the company's brand further. Upon looking at the app for the first
              time, I noticed a lack of visual design and a lack of translation of the brand into visual designs. I wanted to
              create consistent guidelines that could be used both internally, and externally within the app and for marketing
              purposes.</p>
              <p class="px-3">I took the direction the brand was already headed and expanded upon it. Being a construction delivery
              app, I wanted to implement this theme throughout. Business wanted to maintain the copper color as the primary color
              for the logo because copper is a prominent material within the industry, so I decided to use it as a baseline.</p>
              <p class="px-3">I see value in working in an Agile/Lean way. This means that development of our brand would be
              ongoing and develop as we learn more about our users. For this reason, the first iteration of our brand guidelines
              isn't fully complete. There are some colors without descriptions because they are ideas for colors we might implement
              in the future.</p>
              <p class="px-3">You may view the first iteration of our brand guidelines below.</p>

              <h3 class="raleway300 px-3">UI Design</h3>
              <p class="px-3">I worked with Lucas, our software engineer, on the next iteration of the app. With relatively strict
              deadlines for deployment, there were constraints with how much we would have time to add or change. My goal was to
              come up with an MVP that would still be a huge step up.</p>
